# VeloPAY

VeloPay is a cross-chain payment system that operates based on your "chat". Essentially, you input text, and we employ sophisticated methods (classifiers/LLM) to generate common transactions according to your intentions, such as swapping, buying/selling, transferring, and more.

We are currently in the process of integrating with Cross-chain NativeSwap and DeFi Txs on Solana. Specific-chain ChatGPT integration is considered also.
